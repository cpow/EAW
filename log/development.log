We soon formed an email chain to share our thoughts and help us get through our corporate days. We shared our humor and a little insight into the human mind. After a while, we realized we were all absolutely insane and thought it would be a good idea to share our more entertaining conversations and stories with the world.</p>
5: <p>This site is the result of years of email conversations between friends. We have highlighted some of more interesting conversations to share on this website. We also want any and all users to share whatever interesting emails they have with us too!</p>
